                          Introduction

Whenever I think about the realities of life, I am often surprised at
what life does to us, to all of us. For a long time, I have observed
that understanding life’s situations—our own and those of others—
can be challenging. We often revolve around ourselves without
considering the broader context. Sometimes, we focus solely on our
own problems, forgetting that others may have equally valid
struggles. There are moments when we cannot empathize with others
and become selfish, prioritizing our own concerns. These are the
experiences and situations that have inspired me to write this
novella, and it is the second novel of a trilogy.
In this novella, I aim to depict life’s harsh realities and situations
using raw and candid language. It explores themes such as distrust,
taking people for granted, and the complications that arise from our
interactions.
The novella delves into several key points:
•   Never believe in someone blindly; ensure their trustworthiness
    before placing your faith in them to avoid disappointment.
•   If someone trusts you, strive to maintain that trust and never
    betray the faith they have in you.
•   Avoid unnecessarily complicated relationships due to
    misunderstandings or rash judgments.
•   Cultivate a strong character that withstands challenges.
•   Uphold integrity and avoid betraying others; if mistakes are
    made, strive to rectify them and earn back trust.
•   When focused on personal goals and growth, maintain clarity
    and perseverance.
•   Despite life’s challenges, strive to maintain a positive outlook.

                                                                    7
•   Due to someone’s reactions and one’s presence, never make
    your affairs complicated nor root out with others. Keep
    everything separate and limited.
Additionally, the novella addresses how we sometimes lose faith in
others, entering a state of doubt where trust becomes elusive. These
themes are central to the novella, which is entirely fictional.
Characters, events, and places are products of imagination, and the
plot is straightforward and accessible, designed to resonate with
readers of all backgrounds. While the novella employs literary
devices and stylistic elements, its primary intent is to impart
meaningful messages, particularly aimed at students and those
navigating life’s complexities.

-The Shadow of the Light Fairy


                          Chapter One

It was almost 07:00 in the evening on 27th July 2021 when Taimur was
sitting alone on the roof and the floor was covered with blood as he
had cut his forearm veins. Then, he gets lost in his lovely past which
has a lot of fantastic memories of his love, Hadia.

It was the same sun of 2020 when Taimur accidentally met with a girl
who was wearing a mask. Actually, Taimur was an intern at Imperial
University (which was also his part-time job) and she was another
intern.

It was totally an accidental meet-up of both members in the university
due to the meeting of their seniors. It was about 12:30 of the day.

Hadia’s senior told her to help Taimur create a WhatsApp group of all
interns because both had many contacts of other interns. Taimur was
shy and hesitated to share his contact number with her. So, he shared
his email account with her and said, “Please send me the link of the
group, and I will join later”.

But at the same time, he realized that he had become a fool when he
thought that he was supposed to be the admin of that group to add other
members for this purpose, he would go through to expose his identity
in the group. But it was too late.

After a few minutes he received a link through mail, and he joined.
Now, he exposed himself by texting her, “Here’s Taimur” After a few
seconds he received a reply “Okay”, “I will assign you an admin”.

It was 01:30 of the day when the story started.

                                                                    11
Now they started working together in a friendly atmosphere and
chilling a lot by sharing such types of stuff which both members
used to enjoy; they used to say charging instead of eating and it
seemed very cool and funny. They engaged with each other
almost the whole day. After 10 days Taimur felt something very
special and attracted him to Hadia. Although Taimur and Hadia
were considered just friends to each other, but it’s natural, that
opposite gender attracts.

He simply expressed his feelings to her. As she was a nice girl,
she said, “We are good friends, nothing more but I can
understand you” These were her words.

She also added, “I have no interest in relationships because I saw
a lot of breakups in the university”.

It hurt Taimur much as he was very serious and emotional in this
matter, perhaps because of his first time in such a relationship but
whatever that was, that was very special for him. Taimur was
down for the count in this matter and insisted on her giving a
bright signal to him or down the matter (blocking him).

Further, she told him, “We have met each other for a few minutes.
You don’t know, even you didn’t see my face either. Maybe after
some meetings your perception about me, will go for mortality”.
She was considering that his perspective would be changed, but
one thing which was pushing Taimur towards her and that’s her
soul, her behavior, her attitude towards him and life, not beauty.
Although she was very beautiful like a fairy, Taimur didn’t see
her clearly as he was an introverted boy but at some point,
because of the mask too.

Hadia denied it in a mannered way but Taimur considered it a
good gesture for the future and continued to insist on her for a
relationship, for the next twenty days. As she was determined
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
 somehow, she continued with her prior decision.

After some time Taimur blocked her on WhatsApp because he
couldn’t live with her as a friend, but Hadia did not want to lose
a good friend. When he blocked her, Taimur’s friend, Saim
advised him to talk to her and sought out the problem then Taimur
did the same. After that, they continued the conversations.

After a quarter of a month, Taimur’s vacation ended, and he
started his internship, but Hadia was still on leave. He was
waiting for her whenever he visited the university. In these days,
Taimur again insisted on her but the matter remained unresolved.
Again, Taimur blocked her and another person, Sameer who was
a mutual friend, explained the whole situation to Taimur that she
wept in front of him, but he was not clear whether she liked him
as a lover or not. It was the second time he unblocked her.

Now, it seemed that Hadia was also absorbed in him, but it was
not sured. Next week Hadia gave good news to Taimur, “I will
come to university by tomorrow”.

It was a piece of breaking news for Taimur. He was very happy
after seeing that text.

Although, they already met, but now there was another thing
which was a heart-full connection from Taimur. But there was
another thing that he was a simple man in reality. He did not have
any interest in brands and fashion as well. He did not try to
impress her in the second meeting and met her at university in
usual dress. That was the 9th Sun of September of the same year.
They introduced their friends to each other and enjoyed a great
breakfast on a fifteen-chair table. There was a damn prank from
Hadia’s side of changing the names but as they had met before.
They had seen pics of each other from another mutual friend,

                                                               13
Samia. So, they recognized each other.



After that, the first words to each other were from Taimur’s side
when they were sitting alone in front of each other, 3-4 steps
away from their friends in the buffet. He said, “How’s your study
going on?”

That was the very first question from Taimur’s side. Might be it
due to Taimur’s shyness, hesitation or perhaps he preferred
formal conversation. But Hadia was surprised at the question and
gave him a cute smile. They both were very nervous because of
their first meeting. But she nodded. Now, Taimur had no words
to speak and almost finished his meeting. But Sameer came near
them and started talking to them.

Now, Taimur presented another treat to both Hadia and Sameer
which was a cold drink with chocolate, and some cookies were
also included. It was a sign of love from Taimur’s side. She
denied it because she had a small handbag. But Taimur thrust that
to her with a smile and said, “It’s yours”.

Then Hadia couldn’t deny it. Taimur was very happy at this but
that was a sign of friendship for Hadia or perhaps she could
understand the matter, but she just kept that because she couldn’t
deny to his best friend or to the person she likes. Maybe she still
considered him, a best friend, but Taimur perceived it as a sign
of love. Because she put him on with a wristband, which she was
wearing on hers.
After that, Hadia told Taimur that she couldn’t continue her
internship due to some reasons but now she wanted to start it again.
Taimur tried to offer her an internship in his office because there was
a vacancy there. He was invited the next day for documentation
purposes.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Now, according to the university policy, only poor students could do
internships in that office, but Hadia’s family status was much
stronger than the university’s policy. So, Taimur tried to expose her
as a poor student, for that purpose he designed her documents in such
a way that she was considered a poor student. Taimur verified all the
documents from one of the offices of the district court and then
submitted them. After Hadia’s interview, they rejected her because
there were some faults in the interview and documents. Her looks
were very charming, and everyone could guess her status.
Now, Taimur wanted Hadia’s company in his office, so he visited
the interviewer’s (Who was female and like Taimur’s friend) office.
He requested Ma’am to offer her an internship. After some gossip,
she considered Taimur’s request and offered her internship but
unpaid.
Now, they were very happy because they could spend the whole day
with each other. Although they were in the same office, there were
sub-offices in that office. So, whenever they wanted to meet, one of
them visited the other’s office.
Although she joined an internship, she told him that was not for him,
that was only to pass her time because she remained free at home but
in reality, she joined for him because she told him later. She told him
that she never thought about relationships because she saw a lot of
breakups.
After a few days of internship, Taimur attracted more towards Hadia
and again tried to convince her but at this time he was very confused
and upset.
He was thinking “If today she will deny, it means she will never give
me a chance to spend life with her”.
That was the main thing that was haunting his mind at that time.

                                                                    15
It was early morning when they left their offices for breakfast where
Taimur wanted to express his feelings. As Taimur was very nervous
about this matter, he got high blood pressure which sped up his
heartbeat and he almost became unconscious. The university
management took him to the hospital in a car, where the doctor said
“He faced a serious anxiety attack”.
Hadia was also very upset and wept a lot. Maybe her heart melted or
she wept for a friend.
The doctor suggested to him, “Take a complete bed rest of two to
three days and be happy, this is the cure for your anxiety”.
But Taimur couldn’t resist himself and the next day he was in
university. Hadia was very angry with him, but she didn’t do
anything.
One of Taimur’s classmates as well as his hostel mates Gull, who
considered him a brother, came to the university and got furious at
him. Why did he come to university while the doctor suggested bed
rest? Taimur requested his ma’am for a couple of leaves, and she
approved it. Now, Taimur was in the hostel, he was missing Hadia,
but he couldn’t do anything.
After a few days, the whole group of their friends decided for an
outing in a food truck situated in the Shalimar Housing Scheme. The
day was decided. They reached the point and enjoyed a treat of fast
food. There were only five friends at this treat. When the treat ended,
it was almost 4:00 in the evening and this was the time when the
university got close. Now, Hadia was in a hurry to go home because
she was late.
Taimur got a bike from Gull and dropped her off at the City Tour
stop, where he said to her, “I Love You”.
She replied, “I Too Love You”.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
She said unconsciously or intentionally no one knew. But the
journey of a two-sided love story began. Might have started before
but now it was exposed. Taimur was very happy and drove the bike
in a very stylish, relaxed, and chill way.
After that, they enjoyed their lives happily with some outings i.e.,
went to parks, to shopping malls for shopping but mostly for window
shopping. There was a true love in them that everyone could see. In
the internship, both were known as intellectual interns by their
performance. As Taimur was in another office, his ma’am was a very
nice lady. On the other hand, Hadia’s Ma’am considered her, her
sister but her assistant got jealous of Hadia’s intelligence and kinship
with seniors.
After a few days, Hadia’s Ma’am got operated on and the assistant
started managing the office. Now, she (the assistant) started rude
behavior with Hadia, but Hadia was bearing these things. After
recovery, Ma’am rejoined the office, then she tried to handle the
situation, but she couldn’t, and then later on she resigned. But before
the resignation she transferred Hadia to another office. That Ma’am
was a very kindhearted lady. Hadia was fed up with the internship
and resigned. The vacations started again, due to an environmental
disease but she used to come to university for Taimur and later
Taimur resigned too. When they resigned almost everyone in
management and most of the internees knew about their relationship.
During the internship, there were normal fights between them,
because Taimur was very possessive in his relationship, which was
not a good gesture for Hadia. Hadia was very friendly, so there were
a lot of restrictions from Taimur.
Now, Hadia started to consider it imprisonment, but she was
tolerating it. Taimur didn’t consider her, but he was so personal in
all matters about him and her. His love had no limits but his
restrictions. There was another thing, that no one knew and that was
                                                                  17
Taimur’s disease which was a psychological disorder. Taimur hid it
because he thought, “Everyone considered me mad”.
There was also a doubt which was created by Hadia’s friend Aliza.
She told Samia about Hadia’s previous relationships of Hadia. When
Samia told him about that, he considered that it was totally wrong,
and she (Aliza) was trying to misguide everyone. He could
understand that Aliza was just constructing Hadia’s image.
Hadia was clear from her side, so she told all the incidents of her
past. She told him about 2-3 boys who proposed to her, but she
denied it. These all incidents took place during the internship. Aliza
also told Samia that she did not like Hadia. This was the main thing
that confused Taimur, “Why she is with her…?”
Now Taimur was very upset about this matter. She also added,
“Hadia is very selfish, and she entraps boys and teachers with her
sweet voice and sugar-coated conversation”.
Aliza didn’t know that Samia was Taimur’s friend and played a main
role in his relationship, after Sameer. She also did not know about
the relationship between Taimur and Hadia. These were the main
reasons which caused restrictions. When Hadia told her about
Taimur she was very excited and desired to meet with him. Taimur
was almost clear about Hadia, but Hadia considered that he had
doubts about her, and that was the lack of trust in Hadia of Taimur,
and vice versa.
Now, they were in their homes with their families and texted to each
other and informed about their routines. Taimoor was doing a job in
a rice mill, and he told her about working and how much work was
hard.
There were some problems in their relationship like doubts on each
other. Hadia considered that Taimoor doubted her and Taimoor
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
considered that she had no trust in him and that he was clear on her
side. But Taimoor was clear about Hadia.
After two- or three-days next month started, which was December
and the birthday month of Hadia. Taimoor was very excited about
the birthday, but he couldn’t buy a gift for Hadia according to the
personality of his lady. He bought three things of which a ring was
on top, and the others were staller and Anklet.
As the university was closed, students were allowed in. So, they
decided to celebrate her birthday at university. All these things were
ready for her birthday, but a minute fight was also part of the day, as
usual. But the matter was resolved by giving some explanation from
Hadia’s side.
After celebrating her birthday at university, Taimoor was convincing
her to go out of the university to the same food track where they
already enjoyed a great meal with their friends. Taimoor was
convincing her because he had a surprise for her, and that surprise
was another birthday cake. But she didn’t know and denied it
because there was no vehicle to go there. At last, he told her about
the surprise and about the source of traveling as well. Then she
agreed. They went there, where they celebrated her birthday and cut
another cake. Taimoor wished her very romantically by using some
beautiful words;
“You know one thing, who is the person who is very happy on your
birthday after your parents or you can say be happier than your
parents, me, I'm that person because on that day ALLAH created a
single piece after a lot of time, even I can say once in the age of
universe. I'm very happy and I have no words for how I can thank
ALLAH and for expressing my feelings too. You're mine and I'm
yours. I'm here for you all the time even after the breakup of my soul
and body. You are a special gift for me from ALLAH. I don't know
what I did so well that ALLAH gifted me such a great person”.
                                                                   19
The scene was very emotional, even though they were filled with
tears. Hadia requested Taimoor for a birthday song in his voice.
Taimoor sang that song which impressed Hadia a lot and she
couldn’t control her tears and she hugged him tightly. It was a sign
of true love which might be she recognized.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy


                        Chapter Two

As Taimoor was suffering from bipolar disorder, he considered
that he was right. So, he often blamed Hadia. She always gave
explanations to resolve the matter and showed her understanding.
Those were lovely days and, in those days, Taimoor said some
poetic lines for her. He proposed these lines to convince her and
show his love too because she was very angry for some reason;
“Listen, Honey, I think there are no more than eight months that
we have met but it seems that we have been in a relationship from
birth. All the things like fun, happiness, and a lot like that have
become the most important memories of my life. You’re in my
every breath, even my heart beats for you. Whenever I see you, it
seems that it is a dream, which is decorated for me. And when you
are not with me, I search for you, I want to spend all my life with
you. If you desire the moon, I will bring you too and I'll put the
stars under your feet, will you give me only one chance?”
Although Taimoor said all these words to convince her and
expose his true feelings for her, another reason too, is why he
said? That was the first proposal of the relationship, and it was
too quick and rushed, so he couldn't explain his feelings. So, he
did that and those were not only lines that were true which he felt
all that for her. He meant that.
In these days, birthday of Taimoor was evented at the same place
in the university. She wished him very diligently, emotionally,
and with love. The wishing lines were the following;
       May Allah! Flourish and prosper you in all your dreams
       and desires. May Allah! Bless you with a lot of happiness
                                                              21
and success at every step of your life. In short, May Allah!
Fulfill your and your Parents’ prayers.
Birthdays come around every year, but beloveds like you
only come once in a lifetime. I’m so glad you came into
my life. Hope your birthday is as amazing as you are.
Another year, another challenge. But you need to always
remember to keep smiling and have a positive outlook on
life, and everything is gonna be amazing as you desire.
First of all, thank you so much for everything. You have
made these months so beautiful and worth memorable.
That was not my childhood but as childhood precious are
counted as precious ones I can say you have made my
childhood worth living. You are that type of person, which
I know, that even at 3:00 am I tell you my any problem…
I believe that I can sleep without worrying about it
because I know my problem will be solved by morning.
You are honestly the kind of a lifeline and beastie that
anyone would want, when they want to live at their fullest,
to laugh out loud, to be carefree about the world, to smile
wholeheartedly. You have an endless beauty with
matchless character and qualities. You just smiled and
made me breathe away; you are just like a luminous Sun
that appears after rain with blessings of joy. You are like
a rainbow who absorbs all tears and transforms them into
colors of happiness.
YOU ARE A MOON which makes us realize that after
every dark night, there is gonna be a bright morning.
Don’t let anyone love you, when you are at your best and
leave you, when your strength and beauty fades…
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
       You are perfect the way you are.
        I have spent very memorable and beautiful moments with
        you, even I can’t explain them in words.
        The journey started in the very 2nd semester on 27 July
        2020. Although, it’s not that magic day. Time passed with
        the speed of a rocket. Full of love, tragedies, fights,
        possessions, craziness and, many more. You made me feel
        like ‘THE MOST SPECIAL PERSON’ on Earth. I can’t
        narrate each event here, one, I’ve shared all these with
        you and don’t have words even to convert the feelings into
        text. You are my true best human.
        You stand with me in every sad and good vibes too. You
        listened to my long-lasting stories, my childhood tricks
        and memories, sad vibes, craziness, happiness, crimes,
        and each type of fun, you can call me non-stop radio
        Pakistan, who speaks with you… You never asked me,
        “Honey*! Please listeners** required rest.” Ha-ha! Even
        Mama said. It is the psyche of humans, where they find
        happiness or appreciation, they desire to go there again
        and again. If I face nothing in the whole day, or a new one
        but I have a night when I get a piece of happiness, all the
        sad vibes go away, and it is all due to a single person, and
        credit goes to you for all these things.
        If you are not like that then I could not change myself like
        this. You are a good person with a beautiful heart, mind,
        soul, patience, tolerance, love, politeness, courtesy, and a
        lot like that.

   You retain me with you with care, mine, attitude, and
   feelings, you keep everything in that place. Never ever did
   you give me a chance to be angry at you, I confess that I
   got jealous many times, but you forget all those feelings.
   Although sometimes you become very cruel, but you are
   good by nature. The main thing you have told all your
   family about me, it is all about trust and confidence. I
   talked to your sister as well, the most amazing moment I
   ever experienced. In the future we will be together, I will
   always be with you, and never be and nor feel you like
   this. I will be with you, hand in hand and these are not
   only words, I mean it.
Some questions can be cleared after reading this portion.
   •   Who is MY LOVE?
   •   Why he is MY LOVE?
   •   What are the qualities of MY LOVE?
   •   What do I want from MY LOVE?
   •   What I can do for MY LOVE?
So here I try to give answers to the above Questions.
My love is the one who is reading this and giving a very
strange smile. Smile!
You are my love because, whenever I talk to you or spend time
with you, I feel better, even in my thoughts or in my dreams
or in real life. I feel like I’m alive and have inner peace. And
when thoughts or dreams become good, real life becomes
beautiful too. I want to spend the rest of my enchanting
moments with the person who is MY LOVE (That is you).
You have nothing un-praiseable, from every angle you are
perfect, the way you talk, the way you care, the way you love,
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
   the way you interact, the way you smile, the way you see, and
   the way you feel perhaps in some moments. Everything is very
   beautiful and sufficient for love.
   The one thing I want from MY LOVE is to stay happy and do
   whatever you want to stay happy. Keep patience, time will
   pass. I can do anything which you want from me…
   ANYTHING! Only bound to some obstacles but I will fulfill
   all of them when I get the opportunity. Now, you are feeling
   that by reading as many slides as possible I become Deputy
   Registrar. But believe me, this is not all that I want to say, it
   is hardly 2% of them.
   Love you so…. Much Mr. T. (Taimoor’s nickname, especially
   Hadia used it.) You are only mine and I am yours. Always
   remember this and stay blessed.
   Once again Happy Birthday. Enjoy every day, every moment
   of your life. I promise I will always be here for you whenever
   you need me.
It was all in written form although she often used to say these
types of lines.
All the things were going very happily and smartly. There were
some issues which seemed to be unresolved. Some were from
Hadia's side and the others were from Taimoor's. But overall, they
were very happy and wanted to stay with each other. They could
bear the bad and good habits and everything like that, it seemed.
But what was going to happen no one knew.
They met after a long time at a historical place of Gujranwala,
that was Sheranwala Bagh, and clicked some pics together, even
Hadia was very happy to see him after a long time and the black
                                                                 25
dress of Taimoor dualized her excitement. They had a great time
together but due to some personal reasons, she left for home.
Taimoor was very angry with her because they met after a long
time and didn’t spend as much time as he expected. But she
convinced him “Next time we will spend sufficient time with each
other”.
Now, his mood was better, and he became happy. That was the
last day of May with a high temperature of coolness.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy


                        Chapter Three

Taimoor was a psychological patient, with this disease he tried
his best to make her happy, but at the same time, he didn't
understand what was right and what other wrong. It was the main
problem and challenge as well for him. He didn't want to lose her
such a loyal and great lady. After that meeting, his trust was
stronger than before.
Now, he was like that child who can’t leave without her mother
even for a moment which is very small with the measurement of
least time. He considered her the heartbeat of his life with the
depth of his heart.
Taimoor had a very bad habit, which was the most disgusting with
saliva. But he considered that thing as a weapon and used it as
well. And that thing was to blackmail his friends emotionally to
convince them for some things and for jobs too, but he used that
weapon rarely.
The worst thing and act he used was on Hadia to expect the same
results as he always got from all his friends and family members.
But he couldn’t even consider the result of this weapon, that it
was creating a negative impression on her and he got some type
of hate in her heart about the personality and the character of
Taimoor, who was a gentleman and character-wise cleared. It
could be said that the result of that weapon was going to be worse
for Taimoor and his future too.
These were the days when the registration of his fourth semester
started and almost all the students had done their registration, but
Taimoor couldn’t do that due to the lack of money. That was not
                                                                  27
a huge amount of money, but he didn’t have that amount, because
his brother didn't get his salary on time.
After a long-term relationship, Taimoor was able to discuss all the
things with her even the very personal and critical affairs which
commonly the boyfriends did not, but he observed that she was
very loyal in his matters. So, he did without any hesitation. As a
result, she asked him for help, as she belonged to a rich family, so
she could pay even though she had her own savings which were
more than his registration fee. As she was attached to him with
the depth of life, she wanted to help him in every step and even in
every breath which could save his life and increase the time of his
life.
When she asked; “I can help you if you don't have any issues?”
She was very nervous at that time because once she tried to help
him financially, but he denied it. When she put some money in
his wallet without his permission, he felt bad and returned that
money. Later he started a part-time job to fulfill his needs, at an
ice cream shop, and Sameer helped him to get that job.
It was a phone call from her side to resolve this problem. She
knew already that he would deny it but she asked him. At that
time, no one could explain his facial expressions. She didn’t know
and she was considering that he would deny, and her expressions
were sad too, like the golden water of her eyes was going to flow.
The behavior of Taimoor about the self-esteem of the money was
very sensitive and he couldn’t compromise on it. Hadia already
faced the same problem when she asked him for money if he
needed it, but he denied it. She gave some money to him, but he
returned that to her purse. It was an embarrassment for her that he
denied that was the reason she was very upset while she was
asking him for help.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
After a while, he replied, “Why not.”
It was shocking as well as surprising for her. She was very happy
after listening to those words.
Now, the place and the time was the topic of discussion about
where they would meet and what would be the time of meeting as
well. It was the main matter of the story which was life-changing
for both people and their lives. It was the bone of contention that
was going to be unsettled. The place was confirmed but the time
of the meeting was unresolved, and it remained the same. And to
resolve that thing he used his worst weapon which had already
failed in her matter, but he again used that and failed.
Actually, university was going to open and till the very first day,
anyone could submit one’s fee. Now, Hadia suggested that on that
day she would give him that amount, and he would be able to pay,
but Taimoor wanted to meet her before that day. So, he wanted to
meet her as soon as possible and that was the reason he agreed to
ask her for help.
He insisted that she meet him before that day, but she didn’t agree.
Because she knew if we met before then he would come to the
hostel before the opening of the university, and she didn’t want
this to happen. She always preferred to stay at home if the
university closed and there were no classes on campus either.
As most of the institutes and offices remained closed due to a fatal
disease. The educational institutes conducted online classes to
continue the study. Now, the attack of that weapon was going to
start, and the conversation was given.
Taimoor said, “I said, you would be there on the campus on the
5th of June so you will have no more discussion on this topic”.
                                                                 29
Hadia, “Please try to understand”.
Now the situation was going out of control, and she tried to
convince him through logic and reason, so she said, “Listen and
tell me one thing”.
Taimoor, “Hmm! I’m listening”.
Hadia, “You have as much money to spend these days, I mean
before the start of university but have to pay your registration
fee”.
Taimoor understood the meaning of this sentence and what she
wanted to say. She clarified to him that she made him feel that he
agreed to the help and she was going to pay his fee. And he said
those words which became the reason for their separation.
He said, “Sorry I made a huge mistake, I was going to take your
help in this matter. Next time I’ll be careful in this regard.”
He also added, “Thank you”
This was the worst weapon which he used to convince her, but he
didn’t even imagine that the result would be in his opposition.
He considered, “She will think, I am thinking that she is not going
to help me that's the reason she is not coming. And she will agree
to come to university on the 5th of June”.
But Hadia replied, “You are the ugliest-minded person I have ever
seen”.
Taimoor considered it a funny thing like a joke and said, “No
doubt”.
But it was the end of the relationship and she replied, “I will never
ever return to you”.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
And after she said this, she ended the call. Taimoor tried a lot to
contact her, but she didn’t respond. It was 4:02 O’clock and he
tried to contact her continuously at 12 O’clock of night. Now,
Taimoor realized that the situation was severe, and he was sad as
well because he thought she couldn’t understand why he said
those words. Now the time had gone and he had nothing which
could help him in this matter but regret. He was trying to convince
her in this regard that he was positive, and he said those words to
convince her to come to university on the 5th of June.
On the very next day, he set out for the hostel and sent her some
pics of some money along with a shopping bag that was proof that
he had money but still she didn't respond to him. Now, Taimoor
was very confused and upset while he was thinking about her. He
thought she would also be very anxious about the situation, but
no one knew whether she was or not, perhaps these were only the
perceptions.
He thought, “She will die and I will too if, at any point in life,
there will be a separation between us”.
But he didn’t know that the situation had arrived, and he should
be ready for that.
He was thinking, “I will settle the matter when I meet her, I know
she will be convinced because she knows that I can't live without
her”.
Perhaps this was only an assumption, and anyone can assume
anything. He tried a lot to resolve that issue, but he couldn’t.
The next day, he talked to her, and their conversation was the
following:


                                                                31
He texted her a lot and she made a call to him and said, “You have
broken my bareness to an extreme level”.
Then he said, “I didn't mean that I have already told you what I
want to say, please try to understand”.
Hadia, “Leave, do, and perceive as you want. Free to go from my
side”.
Taimoor, “Are you mad, try to understand why I said and what I
said”.
Hadia, “Stay happy, and may ALLAH help you in all your
desires”.
Taimoor, “I’m saying that I have said all those to blackmail you
emotionally. So, that you come”.
Hadia, “When you don’t even know on which thing you reacted or
showed your ugliest mind. I don’t have anything more to say. To
make someone understand one’s mistakes every time. I can’t do
this anymore”.
Taimoor, “You don’t understand why I said that.”
Hadia, “Don’t call and text me again and again”.
Taimoor, “Are you mad. Please!”.
Hadia, “All I have to say. Goodbye!”.
She ended the call.
It was the fifth of June when Taimoor was trying to make her
understand the meaning of the conversation.
The next day, Taimoor texted her, “Good morning, have a great
day”.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Taimoor called her, and she picked up and said, “I said don’t call
me, or text me again and again”.
Taimoor said in a slightly angry mood, “Don’t end the call”.
She replied, “When you can’t understand yourself, I’m not gonna
make you”.
Again, Taimoor repeated his words why he said all that, and then
she replied, “Fine, what else?”
She ended the call and Taimoor again called him, but she didn’t
pick up. On the same day, Taimoor sent her some pics of shopping
bags and
money as well to prove that those were only blackmailing words,
nothing more.
She called him and said, “I have nothing to say on this. No answer
to your useless explanation. You don’t even know what you have
to justify. And I’m not in the mood to think about it, it must end or
not. No need to text me a lot or call again and again in vain”.
Taimoor, “You are my lady if I do not talk to you then who will?”
He said it in a very lovely and polite way.
Hadia, “No, I am not. I hardly remember your name. Don’t force
me, and mind your own business”. She said these words in a rude
way then Taimoor said, “Please, okay it’s fine as you wish if you
would not come then it’s fine, I’m happy too”.
Hadia, “You don’t even bother with my texts. This is your
seriousness towards talking to me. No need to be in contact with
me”.
Taimoor, “Please!”.
                                                                  33
Hadia, “Last time I'm saying this to you. Stop bothering me. Don't
call me and all again and again”.
Taimoor replied innocently, “No, I’ll. It’s my habit”.
She ended the call. It was very rude behavior of Hadia towards
Taimoor because she was very angry at him. Taimoor was
considering that he would be able to convince her when they met
on campus because he believed that his love would defeat all the
misunderstandings. But he didn’t know that the quantity of
misunderstandings was like the ocean of the world which
someone could cross but couldn’t not drink.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy


                        Chapter Four

Taimoor was in his hostel and was trying to contact Hadia but he
couldn’t because she did not want to talk to him. That's the basic
reason.
Now, he was with Gull and said to him to talk to her and try to
convince her.
He replied, “You are trying to push a spring and you know that
spring always revolts and tries to release itself. She is like a
spring you pushed her, and she came into a relationship with you
but now she is trying to revolt and free herself but you want to
pull again. I told you about her and that she is not a lady like you
want and you deserve to be. She is not more than a typical girl,
she is not an exceptional girl, she is normal. And according to me,
now you don't push the spring.”
Taimoor said, “I love her Gull, and you know it all”.
Gull, “I know but you don’t know the reality. There is no love in
this world and according to me she doesn’t love you and even she
did not till today. She was in a relationship with you because you
forced her”.
Taimoor was so surprised, but he believed that she loved him and
still he did.
So, he replied to Gull, “She loves me, and she did and that’s the
thing I know well. Because when I proposed to her that day she
accepted and that's the proof.”


                                                                 35
Gull, “I know but you should know what the reason behind that
was. She accepted your proposal due to your illness; she talked
to Sameer and asked him all the things and he convinced her and
told him that she was the basic reason for your disease and then
she decided to live with you and that’s all”.
Taimoor, “What are you talking about?”
Gull, “This is the reality, and you should keep it in your mind.”
Taimoor, “But, I can’t live without her, and you know very well”.
Gull, “Listen Taimoor, the world is so cruel. It dreams to you and
when you try to fulfill your dreams it pushes you away and then
you have only one thing to give up and take another way. Because
then you will find nothing whether you wait for twenty hours,
twenty suns or twenty rains. Your efforts and tries of all things
like that will all be in vain. So according to me, you must leave
the path and take another way of life”.
Taimoor, “But how, Gull?”
Gull, “You know the one thing, people always say that ‘There is
a helping hand of a woman behind a successful man’. This is the
wrong concept; the woman selects that person who is already
successful, and this is the conclusion of life. Maybe it would be in
the age of that person who said this nonsense. According to me
you should become a successful man then all the women and girls
of the world will be ready to marry and love you. If you don’t
believe it, do it and you will find the effect?”
Taimoor, “So, according to you there is no love then what was
that?”
Gull, “I have already told you what that was…”
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Taimoor, “You mean love is imprisoned in the cage of fate and
she caged him for a lifetime. If someone finds love, in reality,
that’s not love, that is the reflection of love from a cage through
the mirror of selfishness. And reflection always seems original
but that has only one side and one effect which has the
opposition”.
Gull, “Yes”.
Taimoor found a piece of courage and tried to control himself.
After that time Gull said goodbye and he left for home as the
university was still closed. But the power of his love was
unbearable for him. He tried his best and texted her, “Now, I have
good news for you. From today I will not call and text you. Be
happy. Goodbye. Stay blessed. But I will love you till death”.
Now, he caught a box of sticks from the shop and started smoking.
He already used smoke that's not unusual but that was not much
in quantity even a single piece over a Sun. He held control over
himself for three nights and then an event happened which was
the main reason for his destruction which he embraced in front of
some of his friends.
One of his friends, named Ahsan was in his hostel, and Gull was
there too. Ahsan was a serious boy, but he was a straight man and
he knew about the breakup. He considered that Taimoor would be
happy if he listened to her voice. Ahsan was a mutual friend too.
So, he called Hadia and talked to her in front of Taimoor and said
Taimoor was calm and silent. He made the loud option of the cell
phone and talking to her.
Taimoor was very angry at his act and at Hadia too that she was
talking to him. Ahsan told a lie to her that he was in his boss’s
house as he was doing an internship too. They talk to each other
                                                              37
for more than twenty minutes and then Taimoor interrupts Ahsan
ends the call and says to Taimoor, “She ends the call when she
hears your voice”.
This was very painful for Taimoor, and he made a call to her,
Hadia picked up a call and she was perhaps waiting for his call.
Taimoor said without any hello, hey “I know one thing and that
is why you ended the call when you heard me. And if you want to
talk to anyone. I have no problem. Keep the one thing in your
mind and that is first investigate that person I am not here and
then talk to that one. And if you’re talking about that, then what
is the problem that I am listening to or not? You were talking to
the person even though I said to avoid talking to him, because you
said to me, he badly talked to you”.
After listening to all that she said, “I was considering that you
would be changed but I was wrong. Now, you have no right that
I will give you justification for this, after this act but I am going
to send one thing: see this and don't try to text me now”.
He received a screenshot of a chat with Ahsan in which Ahsan
texted to her, “I will talk to you later, and sir has just arrived”.
Now, Taimoor was very ashamed about this act, but time has gone
and he was very angry at Ahsan because she got angrier at him
due to Ahsan. He hurt a lot and a stream of golden water started
flowing from his eyes and he hugged Gull tightly. Perhaps no one
could understand him at this time, no one could feel him and his
feelings too.
Some people understand the feelings, and some define but
Taimoor was a person who had three skills and those were
understanding, defining, and suffering. He was suffering from
feelings that might be temporary or permanent, but the thing was
how one could get rid of them?
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Gull encouraged and believed him that everything would be fine
in the next few days and didn’t worry about that. And he decided
to talk to her about the matter and he was sured that he would
convince her.
After two or three days he went to his home and Taimoor was
alone at the hostel. There was no other one with him except her
memories which hurt him a lot and they always became
successful in making him cry. Then he called Gull and asked him
about the situation and investigated whether he talked to her or
not. He didn't tell him but given the situation of Taimoor, Gull
ended the call and made a call to Hadia.
Hadia, “Hello! How are you, Gull”?
Gull, “I’m fine, what about you?”
Hadia, “I’m fine too”.
Gull, “I want to talk to you about the most important thing of your
life”.
As Gull knew if she loved him then it would be the most important
thing of her life but to some extent, he knew that she did not, but
he said that. At this she replied, “I have nothing important which
we can discuss”.
As she knew what he was going to talk about. And she ended the
call.
Taimoor was waiting for a reply, and he was considering that Gull
would convince her by giving some explanations and as he had
seen the confidence of Gull. He knew that he had dealt with a lot
of girls, so he also knew how to handle the situation. But he didn’t
call Taimoor because he couldn’t say the things which he listened
                                                                 39
to. When he waited for more than three hours, he was sure that he
couldn’t convince her.
After two or three days, the university reopened and she came to
change sections as she already shifted in his sections before the
breakup but now, she wanted to reverse them. Taimoor was in the
university, and he talked to her face to face in the university. But
one night before the meeting he told her something which made
her cry. He would die or attempt suicide if she would not be with
her and that was true.
Now, they were in front of each other, but she was very angry
even though she didn’t want to talk to him. She didn’t talk to him,
that's why she moved to the library and told him not to chase her.
He remained silent and waited for her at the door of the library.
After some time, he again faced an anxiety attack and his
heartbeat became fast, he felt a lot of problems with inhalation.
Even his breathing almost stopped, then they called an
ambulance, and they shifted him to the hospital.
When he was facing the attack, Hadia was standing behind him
and was watching the whole situation. She later told him, when
he again came to the university after an hour, that she was going
to go to the hospital, but her friend Aliza did not agree. She took
him into the discussion hall of the university where they talked to
each other. Aliza was very angry at him because Hadia told him
all the conversation which was held last night. So, she asked her
to go out, but Hadia refused and asked her to go out. She would
meet her after some time.
She carried him to the buffet of the university and presented him
with lunch along with tea. After lunch, she sat with him outside
the buffet and watched the bernola which was pierced in his veins
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
to inject some medicine into his body. When she saw that she
cried, and his eyes were
full of tears. She asked, “What is your problem? Why are you not
going to be right? Tell me why?”
She said these words in a very harsh way and then she tried to
eject his bernola too and she could feel the situation and pain too.
It could be seen by her expressions. They spent the rest of the day
with each other but at the end of the day she told him, “Don't
consider it a good sign, it was help which I can for any person as
humanity”.
After her reply, Taimoor became sad, and he was thinking about
the nature and love of Hadia about himself, and he considered that
she would change.
He kept on trying and he tried to convince her, but how much he
tried the matter became serious and difficult. And the time arrived
when he became hopeless.
During this period, he called his best friend Saim, whom he
considered his brother, and asked him for a job detail in Dubai.
His brother was in Dubai and working in a company as a manager.
Taimoor was only talking about the job details, but he asked why
he wanted to go abroad as he was a brilliant student then he must
continue his studies and complete his degree. Then Taimoor told
me why he wanted to go abroad.
Taimoor, “I can’t live without her and if she is in front of me then
it will be very difficult for me to live, I can attempt suicide. So,
please do something as soon as possible and tell me the details”.
He said these words with an uncontrollable flow of tears and Saim
could feel the pain. He wanted to help him in this regard.
                                                               41
So, he replied, “Why have you become hopeless and why are you
crying? Listen, if you agree then I can talk to her. And I will
convince her in such a way that she will do as I say. Don’t worry”.
Taimoor, “No, you can’t convince her now. I know what the
situation is going on”.
As Saim had already faced these types of situations and had some
ideas about girls, Taimoor agreed. Saim made a promise from him
that he would not ask him about their conversation, but he would
tell him about the topic of discussion. It was not a big deal because
he respected and trusted him more than a brother. He knew that
he would not try to impress her or anything else like this. And he
had also explained the character of Saim in such a way that she
also respected him. So, Saim started talking to her.
On the first day he told him that they talked about the flaws and
the reasons why this all happened. The next day they talked about
a topic but not much.
Saim called him and said, “If I tell you the reality then you are
wrong, and she is right”. Taimoor felt ashamed and got angry at
this as he was like his lawyer, and he said to him, but he didn’t
react.
After 3-4 days Taimoor asked him “What is the situation”.
Saim told him, “Today we didn’t talk about you”.
Taimoor replied, “But you said that today you talked a lot with
her”.
Saim, “Yes. It’s true but we didn’t talk about you”.
Taimoor, “So, what were you talking about?”
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Saim replied, “I am trying to take her in confidence, and I’ll do it
soon”.
Taimoor said, “Okay. Do it as fast as possible”.
But the situation with Taimoor was very bad and the very next he
saw her, she did not talk to him, even though she said, “Don't
chase and frustrate me”.
These were the only words for her but those were like atom bombs
that fell on Taimoor, and his hope totally disappeared, and he
became hopeless. He left the university and went to the tuition
center.
In the way he told to Saim, “I am going to commit suicide but last
time I want to see. I want to see her shiny eyes. You know her eyes
are the most attractive thing which she has and then her voice. I
want to see her eyes and listen to her voice”.
Saim, “What are you talking about and where are you now?”
Taimoor, “I’m going to university”.
Saim, “I said wait”.
Taimoor, “No. It’s over now”.
And he powered off his mobile phone and went to university. He
met her and said to her, “I want to talk to you for the very last
time”.
At the same time, all his hostel mates came to him and told him
to go along with them.
He said, “Okay, give me just five minutes. I want to talk to her”.
They agreed and sat there.

                                                                 43
They started to talk to each other, and time passed very quickly
even though he did not realize that they were going.
In that meeting, she told her that she visited a doctor who told her.
She was suffering from a cancerous tumor, but the final reports
were still pending. She told him that it was the second reason why
she ended the relationship. When he heard it, he could not control
his tears and said sorry and blamed himself as a selfish person.
And she also said, “Saim said to me, he will erase even my name
from your mind, but I don’t think he will be able to”.
On that day, he canceled the plan of suicide and decided to live
close to her to take care of and look after her at university. Even
if he said anything that could hurt him, he would listen with
laughter. He saw her off and while they were going toward the
bus station, he was holding her hands, and his tears were flowing
with the speed of light. He also shared the incident with Saim and
told him to do something as soon as possible.
He also said, “Don’t share with her, he told me to keep it secret.
But you know why I have told you”.
Saim said, “Maybe he told you a lie. It can be a trap so that you
stop chasing her”.
Taimoor, “No. I have trust in her. She can’t tell me a lie”.
Saim, “She told me that she visited a doctor but didn’t tell me
why?”
Taimoor, “She told?”
Saim, “Not still but she said she would tell”.
Taimoor, “She will not”.
Saim, “Hahahaha! Let’s see Mr. Taimoor”.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Taimoor, “Maybe she will”.
Saim, “Actually I have a bad tongue which makes trust very fast.
I think we should sleep now. It’s 2:42. And don't worry it will
demand time, but I will normalize everything”.
Taimoor, “Okay Thank You”.
And the conversation ended.




                                                             45
                         Chapter Five

He started to offer prayers regularly and pray for her. His prayer
for her was like, “Oh My Lord, You are the creator of the world
and You said there is nothing beyond your reach, when You said
the word “Kun” the universe came into existence. Even no one
leaf can change its position without your permission. You said in
Quran ‘ALLAH has control over everything’ and You have. You
have the power of creation, You can do everything and there is
nothing impossible in front of You, because You decide, what is
possible and which is not possible for us. The concept of possible
and impossible is only for us. You have no words like this. I have
drowned in the ocean of sins and maybe I have no right to wish
or pray for anything in front of You but You say that your treasure
is infinite, which will not be empty ever, even there will be no
change in that. Then I can expect from You only the fulfillment of
one thing and that is the life of Hadia. In return for this, I will
never desire to get her in front of You”.
And during his prayers, his eyes flew like the storm of July. Might
be his love was more than the expectations of anyone. He often
said to Hadia that he could die for her.
Even he said to her, when she told him about her disease, “If the
disease is related to the heart, mine is ready for the transplant but
it's my bad luck. You have caught that disease. I cannot do
anything. I am feeling helpless and weak”.
This was the power, craziness, beauty, height, and the reality of
his love.
On the very next day, Saim said to him that he talked to her, but
he couldn't convince her. And said to him, “Now, you are the only
person who can convince her”.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Taimoor, “I can”.
The tune was like a question, so Saim replied, “Yes. Even now
you are the only person who can convince her”.
Taimoor, “But how?”
Saim replied, “I will guide you and she will be convinced.
Tomorrow your task will start”.
Taimoor, “Okay”.
And the conversation ended.
The next day he came to know that her reports had a negative
result which made him very happy. On that day he did all the
things that he told him. There were a lot of restrictions along with
a bundle of stupidities. But he did all the things that Saim said to
him. More than 25 days passed since the breakup happened. And
he was doing all the things which he recommended to him. On 30
June her friend Aliza was also in university and Taimoor talked
to her and convinced her. She told him to move on.
In those days some boys irritated him, and the same boys were
teasing Hadia, but she did not react to that even though she was
enjoying that teasing or maybe that was nothing like teasing.
Which hurt him a lot. While they were teasing Hadia Taimoor
called one of them and tried to make him understand angrily. At
the end of the discussion, he said sorry to Taimoor.
She was normal with Taimoor as some days ago she was very
angry, and her behavior was too rude to him. On the same day,
Taimoor set out for his home and talked to her, but she behaved
rudely a lot without any reason.


                                                                 47
The next day, he was with Saim as he was at his house. They were
sitting in a shop and were talking about the decision of suicide
that Taimoor had taken some days ago and making fun of
Taimoor, but he was happy too and did not show his pain to them.
At the same time, Saim was texting Hadia. Saim texted her,
“Have you talked to Taimoor or not?”
She replied, “Please. I do not want to talk about him”.
Saim said, “Good”.
As Taimoor was sitting beside him, he was watching all this but
might be Saim didn’t realize. The replies of both people were very
shocking for him, and he became nervous and again faced an
anxiety attack. They took him to the hospital. He didn’t inhale for
five minutes but the doctor managed the situation. His friends and
family were too with him and some of them were crying. At
discharge time the doctor said to his father, “Please try to make
him happy and fulfill his demand and I know what that is?”
After listening, his father felt embarrassed and ashamed of his
training.
On the same day, Hadia talked to Taimoor’s sister and said to her
that she was not the reason for his attack. They should consult a
neuro-specialist or any psychiatrist. This was also very shocking
for him.
He also felt ashamed of those words, but the situation was not his
choice. And he started to control his emotions and feelings.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy


                         Chapter Six

After a few days when he felt better, he went to university and
saw all the situation. He observed that she was wandering with a
group of boys. They were those whom Taimoor said to make a
group and they made one too and they lived together in the
university but now they were with her.
Already someone told Taimoor about the situation, but he did not
believe it. He also saw that she had lunch with them. He observed
that she also sat with another boy who was not even in their
department. But he was still hopeful and thought that she was
trying to make him jealous.
On 10 July when he texted Saim and wanted to talk on this matter.
Saim told him that he could not talk to him on call because he was
with his mother; she was a patient with Hepatitis and diabetes. As
Taimoor learned about her disease he said, “Okay”.
After some time, he did not receive a text. So, he called him to
decide whether he slept or not. When he made a call to him, he
realized that he was on another call.
Saim texted her angrily, “I said don’t call me, but you did. Why?”
Taimoor apologized to him and told him, “You did not reply so I
did”.
He replied, “Okay”.
Taimoor asked him, “You said that you were in your mother’s
room, and I would not call you but you were on another call”.
Saim, “Yeah, I was talking to my cousin”.
                                                               49
Taimoor, “But you said I would not call you. You told a lie”.
And he was shocked and said to him, “Send me the screenshot of
the call”.
Saim said, “If I do not send. Then?”
Taimoor, “Nothing”.
Saim sent the screenshot of the call logs but there was no record
of his cousin’s call.
Taimoor said, “Where is your cousin’s call?”
He replied, “I was not talking to him”.
Taimoor, “Then whom you were talking to?”
Saim, “I don’t consider answering it”.
Taimoor, “I know whom you were talking to. Hadia. You were
talking to Hadia”.
Saim, “Yes. Then?”
Taimoor, “I already have doubts”.
Saim, “You are talking about my character”.
Taimoor, “I’m not blaming your character. It was the fact when
I made a call to you and you were busy on another call, so the
doubt was created”.
Saim, “I know what the meaning of your doubt is”.
Taimoor, “There is no other meaning except me told you”.
Saim, “I am not a child”.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Taimoor tried a lot, but he did not convince him of the meaning
of his word “doubt”. At the end, he said to Saim, “Listen Saim if
you’re still trying to convince her then please don’t try. I don’t
need her. Don’t even talk to her”.
It did not mean that he did not love her now, he only fulfilled his
promise which he made with ALLAH Almighty in his prayers.
He did not understand, so he replied, “Who are you? What is your
relationship with her?”
Taimoor said, “I am the person who requested her to talk to you”.
Saim, “Now, you can restrict her”.
These words hurt a lot, but he did not react and said politely, “You
know we are friends”,
Saim, “No. We are not, and you can’t stop me”.
In the end, Taimoor said, “I thought you knew the meaning of
friendship but perhaps I was wrong. According to me, friendship
is a responsibility which should be fulfilled by all sides. There is
nothing like friendship, it is the most beautiful and advantageous
relationship in the world, which amuses us all the time without
any reason. But I think you have no idea about it and are a foolish
man trying to convince a scholar who knows all the things. Sorry
dude”.
Taimoor tried a lot to save his friendship, but he could not. He
surrendered himself to the battlefield of fate which was helping
to selfishness. He had lost a friend, and a brother, which was a sad
thing for him. He was very emotional and was going to be in tears.
The next day Saim told her that Taimoor had a doubt about them
which was one of the other reasons who ruined Taimoor.
                                                            51
Hadia called him and insulted him for doubting them and said,
“You have told one of Saim’s friends that he talks to me”.
But Taimoor did not tell anyone. Now, he got to know what Saim
told him and guided her to what Taimoor told him. Because no
one knew about the conversation between Hadia and Saim except
Taimoor, Saim, and Hadia. Taimoor did not tell him, Hadia did
not know him who could tell? Obviously, Saim.
Now, Taimoor had nothing except he could blame on fate that no
one had even sympathy like words besides his family. The
quantity of the sticks was increased. Perhaps he wanted to get lost
in the smoke of those sticks so that no one could search for him
or maybe he wanted to disappear from memories and the pain like
the smoke of sticks. But it seemed to be impossible, and he felt
mad because he saw a lot that hurt him and due to which he was
dying day by day. It was the usual thing, which could not be
neglected.
He saw that she sat, and talked with boys in the library in such a
frank way like they were familiar to each other since their
childhood. Even Taimoor tried to talk to her, but she denied it,
which hurt him a lot and he felt his soul was extracted from his
body and he was no more. He texted her and gave her
explanations. But as usual, he could not clear misunderstandings.
The relationship was shaped into cancer and the poison of the
cancerous tumor was already spread, it was considered the best
way to get rid of that tumor by eliminating that part of the body
and now the time had come when that should be eliminated too.
But Taimoor was not able to do that even though he was a coward
in this regard.
He decided that he would blackmail her and tell her to come to
university, when she came, he would convince her, and he hoped.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
He blackmailed her and told her to come to university on the 12th
sun of July. She was hurted by this type of act and at the same
time Taimoor received a call from his brother who told him,
“There is everything all right between you and Saim because he
told me to meet him. Maybe he wants to tell me something”.
His tone was questioning so Taimoor answered, “No, everything
is alright”.
Later, he realized that Saim would tell his brother about the phone
call that he made to Hadia because she had told him. So, he made
a phone call to Saim’s brother and told him about the interference
of Saim in his matters, but he did not tell all about the incident,
not even about the relationship and all. Although his brother tried
to investigate the matter, Taimoor did not tell him. In the end, he
assured him that Saim would not interfere again. His brother also
told Taimoor to meet him and told him all the matters and that he
would resolve all his problems regarding Saim.
After some time, it was informed to Taimoor that a lawyer made
a call to Saim and said to him, “A Taimoor-named boy harassing
Hadia, there will be a great problem for him”.
And this was the matter that Saim called Taimoor’s brother.
After telling him, they suggested to Taimoor to return home. But
Taimoor explained the things and facts that that recording was not
real, and in fact that was fake. If a lawyer would call, one would
be to Taimoor's father or his brother, but he did to Saim, and it
was made by Hadia and might be Saim participated too. Taimoor
found out that it was a scam.
He called Saim and suggested that he try to avoid interfering in
his matters, but Saim abused him and ended the call.
                                                                53
The next day Hadia was at university. They met each other and
they talked to each other to solve the matter. Hadia also brought
gifts that Taimoor gave her to return them.
Hadia, “Let me check your phone. I want to check, maybe you will
record the conversation”.
She checked his smartphone and then they started a conversation,
again she seemed to be innocent and was weeping continuously
and Taimoor was too.
She said, “I have told my both brothers and dad too. My mother
already knew”.
Taimoor, “So, what did they say about this?”
Hadia, “They said, everyone makes the same mistake at this age
because they are liberal types. My brother suggested to me that I
must return your gifts”.
Taimoor was very surprised that she could tell a lot of lies.
Taimoor, “Really”.
Hadia, “Yes. They are not like your family. I said that they are
liberal, they have no issue”.
Taimoor, “OH”.
She wept, which made Taimoor emotional, and he gave her his
mobile phone and told her all the passwords, even her finger
recognition was already added, and she deleted all the pics which
could be dangerous for her. At last, she reset his mobile. And then
Taimoor was tried but he did not.
Taimoor asked her, “Do you have any contact with Saim?”
She said, “No, I haven’t contacted him for the last two weeks”.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
He knew she told him a lie, but he did not react and ignored her
all the stream of lies.
She told him, “I want to die, because when my parents know
about me, what they will think”.
Now, Taimoor realized that she did not tell them about the
relationship. Then he was thinking about the fake lawyer. But he
said, “I will die too if you commit suicide”.
And he was speaking the truth; these were not only words.
At the end of the meeting, she said to him, “You were
blackmailing me that you will come to my home. You will enter
the house but then no one can know about you. You don’t know
my father; he is more than a DON and even my mother said we
invite you to lunch. I am giving you a warning”.
But Taimoor knew she could only warn him and even he did not
care about her parents and brothers. Actually, her brothers were
students too. One of them was Ali who was doing BBA from SMT
(School of Management and Technology) Lahore and was
interested in poetry too which meant he had deep thought on such
types of matters and the other one was Ahad who was doing
mechanical engineering from UST (University of Science and
Technology) Islamabad and part-time businessman of knives
manufacturing. The third one was not at home; he was living in
England. They were not children or illiterate; they could
understand the situation and they would make the right decision.
Even they investigate the matter first.
When they were going outside, he was trying to make her
understand to avoid this type of action, but she did not respond.
When Taimoor went outside on the road, he was in the middle of
                                                              55
the road and wanted to die but he saw she was going toward the
bus station. He thought he should follow her, and he did. She was
going to her house very carefully and when she went to her house
Taimoor came to his hostel. Actually, Taimoor could not
understand the situation.
After that, she texted him, “You made the mistake of blackmailing
me. Now, you have no evidence”.
Taimoor sent her some evidence and told her, “You have reset it,
and when I logged in to my mail account that evidence appeared
again”.
She logged in to his account because her mobile phone was still
in trusted devices, and she knew the password too so she could.
She deleted his data then she deleted his account too, but he also
received a notification and because he had recovery mail and
numbers, he recovered his account again but there was no data in
that account.
After some days, the university reopened and he was surprised
when he saw she was walking with Saim, even though Saim was
not a student at that university. Now, he was cleared to some
extent but not and he was hurt a lot, but he controlled himself and
ignored all the matter.
Everyone told him about her in bad words even girls did not like
her much. His friends of both genders tried to convince him that
she was not a loyal girl now he had to move on, but they could
not. The cruelty from her side increased day by day and one day
he gave up and surrendered himself to the trap of situations and
tricks of fate.
He planned to suicide and for that purpose, he decided to capture
some videos for his family, friends, and management of the
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
university as all knew about their relationship and break up too.
So, he captured those videos for the preservation of Hadia’s self-
esteem because he knew everyone would blame her after his
death. He captured more than 20 videos and wanted to send them
and gave her his mobile too. And wanted to tell her to whom she
would send which video to which person.
So, the plan was made and on the fixed day he went to her city, to
his house, even tried to knock but didn't because he realized that
she did not tell his family. After some time, she made a call to
him and requested him to leave her city. She would obey him in
every matter when the university would reopen. He left her city
without giving her his cell phone. As he could not give her a
mobile in which he captured videos, he did not commit suicide
and it was the third time when he canceled his plan. He thought,
“These are the traps and conspiracies of fate”.
These days, a girl Aish texted him for help in study as he was very
intelligent so, often his classmates texted him for help. After help,
they talked to each other and then he realized he could help others
in this regard he started to help others and he did a lot. Aish texted
him when she needed help after a few days they talked about
Taimoor’s matter as everyone knew about his relationship.
Taimoor told her all the situations and incidents but did not tell
her about the mistakes of Hadia. She told him, “According to me
she doesn’t love you. If she loves you, she ignores such mistakes,
these are normal, and all couples have these types of fights on a
casual basis”.
They talked to each other as Taimoor considered himself the
reason for their breakup, so he was always a lawyer for Hadia.
But Aish gave him explanations and always told him “She was
not a loyal girl, and these things are not allowed in our religion
                                                                57
too. So, move on, and as a friend, I am always with you.
According to me, you have to make an engagement with a girl of
your age. It will minimize your tension and distract your mind too
from that disloyal girl”.
That was the main topic of their discussion all the time. The other
family members of Aish were staying in America. She always
requested him to pray for her too that her family would come back
soon.
He said, “My prayers are always embraced for others, in front of
ALLAH Almighty but rarely for me, will they return soon.”
She became happy.
Now, they always had fun and even talked about their marriages.
Sometimes they bet on each other who would marry first. She
changed him a lot and now he dared to see his lover in front of
him and could stay without her. She encouraged him and as a
friend, she helped him a lot in this regard. He was the person who
helped others in their studies but on the other hand, she was the
lady who helped him in this matter.
In those days, he met a girl whose name was Zaini. She pranked
him in his first semester but not much. She did all that in such a
way that Taimoor enjoyed it too. Now he started to play pranks
on her. The first day Taimoor said to her, “I need your help”.
Although he did not need that, he said.
She was an intelligent and nice girl but a bit naughty. As she was
a nice girl she said, “Why not? Tell me, how can I help you?”
Taimoor told her the matter and she helped him. And they started
to talk to each other. Although, she was very intelligent but a bit
naughty too.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Taimoor was an expert in operating computers, so she said to him,
“Will you teach me how to use computers? Meaning I want to
operate it like you”. Pointing towards a computer.
Taimoor said, “Yes, why not but you will teach me English”.
She agreed and Taimoor laughed a lot innerly because he listened
to her before their meeting. And Aish always praised Taimoor for
his English speaking and often said to him, “Please teach me
English?”
But Taimoor always said, “Sorry, I cannot. I am not as much able
as you people consider”.
This was the simplicity of Taimoor.




                                                              59
                       Chapter Seven

Taimoor often told Aish about Zaini and their conversation, and
they enjoyed it a lot. Taimoor talked to her only for fun and to
pass the time in university and considered him a friend no more.
As he did not forget Hadia. But she considered him a playboy as
she knew about his relationship too.
She was not his classmate, but most of the students in other
sections knew him as an intelligent boy. Although they also knew
about his relationship. She knew through Taimoor's school friend,
as his friend was her classmate, so she did not know him. He was
a person whom girls texted him about their matters without any
hesitation. Even those girls made calls and texted him who did
not talk to anyone in the class. This was the matter, once she
avoided Taimoor after that Taimoor did not try to contact her as
much as they had because he was not interested in her.
Taimoor was a person who did not try to impress anyone, he
always said, “I have no interest in that type of job”.
But the fact that his politeness and tolerance, which was
considered negative, means that he tried to impress someone. He
was a person who carried a lot of fun and entertainment only for
those who were very close to him. But he was considered a serious
man in front of those who did not know him. Even though he
could impress anyone, he did not try it, and without any effort a
lot of people were impressed.
One thing that was prominent in his behavior was his purity for
everyone. He was not hypocritical by nature. Most of his
classmates liked him and had very friendly behavior with him.
And that was the purity of his personality.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
After two- or three days Sameer came to him, and he saw Taimoor
was very upset. When he saw the situation he said, “Tell me one
thing when you realize the reality”.
Taimoor, “I have understood the situation, but my heart cannot.”
Sameer gave him a laugh and said, “What a filmy dialogue”.
Taimoor, “You can’t understand me because you did not love
anyone, which means don’t have such feelings”.
Sameer, “I did not. You said I did?”
Taimoor, “Yes”.
He laughed and said, “There were four members in our group”.
Taimoor, “I know but there was no one at extreme level because
you know, you cannot marry her. I did with the depth of heart”.
Sameer, “What did you do? Tell me, you did with the depth of
heart, tell me what you did”.
Taimoor was silent at this then Sameer said, “You know we all
know about the termination of your relationship, but we did not
tell you”.
Taimoor was surprisingly looking at him and had no words to say.
And then said, “I know why you people did not tell me because I
could not understand at that time”.
Sameer, “Yes that’s the reason”.
Taimoor took him out for a walk and started an almost endless
conversation, but they concluded that after two to three hours.
Taimoor, “Sameer, what do you think about love?”

                                                             61
Sameer, “According to me, Love is a combination of emotions
and behaviors characterized by closeness, passion, and
determination. It includes care, closeness, safety, attraction, love,
and trust. The intensity of love can vary and change over time”.
Taimoor smiled and said, “You always follow Google.”
Then he questioned, “And how will you explain being in love?”
Sameer, “Well, being in love means wishing your partner
happiness, praising one for the person one is for, and
encouraging oneself to become a better person. When you are in
love, your relationship goes beyond a simple physical attraction”.
Taimoor, “You gave the same answer which everyone does, and
it is also googled”.
Sameer, “That’s not love?”
Taimoor, “It is love according to a lot of people like you but not
to me”.
Sameer, “So, what is love according to you?”
Taimoor, “According to me love is the name of oneness”.
Sameer, “Oneness? What is this oneness?”
Taimoor, “You don’t know the meaning of oneness”.
Sameer, “Yes, I don’t know”.
Taimoor, “We say ALLAH means we confess that there is no one
except ALLAH who can replace Him. If someone then one could
replace, that’s the oneness of ALLAH”.
Sameer, “I could not understand what you said?”
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Taimoor, “Listen! Similar to that oneness, we consider there is
no other one, we are one, means whom we love. It is love, when
there is the concept of two vanished but one then two people can
love each other. They are two by bodies but one by soul”.
Sameer, “Whatever the love is, break up happens; I know only
one thing”.
Taimoor, “There is no breakup in love”.
Sameer, “Hahahaha! I saw a lot of, and you say there is no
breakup in love and even you have faced it too. Break up is the
finishing line of the love race”.
Taimoor, “You said correctly but you said about that love which
you considered but in reality, there is no breakup in love”.
Sameer, “Can you explain it?”
Taimoor, “Tell me why the breakup happens?”
Sameer, “It’s simple, first of all, there are rarely people who love
each other, otherwise one of two people flirting and if both
persons are sincere then they cannot understand each other and
if they can understand then other people create the
misconceptions and misunderstandings in their relationship”.
Taimoor, “Absolutely right. Now tell me, have you ever beaten
yourself for your mistake or misbehavior with you?”
Sameer, “No. Never. What a ridiculous question”.
Taimoor smiled and questioned him, “Why?”
Sameer, “Because I made a mistake”.


                                                                 63
Taimoor, “If I talk about you then you think whenever you make
a mistake, you make a mistake with you”.
Sameer, “Yes, normally the same thing happens”.
Taimoor smiled and said, “And if someone except you beats you
or makes a mistake with you. What do you do?”
Sameer, “I answer ones for that”.
Taimoor, “Why?”
Sameer, “Because that one hurt me”.
Taimoor, “And why didn’t you do the earlier one”.
Sameer, “Because that’s me”.
Taimoor, “Absolutely, that’s your love for yourself. When you
know that you made a mistake with you, you ignore it but when
you realize that it's not you then you react. Now, I talk about love,
in love, we consider one, and when one of those makes a mistake,
the other one ignores it by considering that it's me too. And in this
love, there will be no breakup”.
Sameer, “Hmm! I didn’t think about this perspective, a wonderful
explanation Taimoor. You are a rock, man”.
Taimoor simply saw him.
After almost two hours passed, they came back to the hostel and
Sameer was getting late. So, he left for home and an informative
conversation ended.
On the very next day, Ahsan visited Taimoor, and they went to a
park. It was the same park where Taimoor and Hadia used to
come. And because Ahsan was a mutual friend it was impossible
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
that they would not talk about Hadia. So, they started a
conversation.
Sameer, “You know one thing, Ahsan, I don’t like it now because
when I see it, it reminds me of things that I want to forget.”
Ahsan, “You still think about her. She is not the right girl for you.
Even though she is not a girl”.
Taimoor saw him and he understood and said, “Listen, I saw a lot
that you did not see. I saw her pictures in Fahad’s cell phone, my
hostel mate and you know what type of person he is. Besides that,
I saw a lot which is unexplainable. So, please forget her. She is
not more than a call girl by character.”
It irritated to Taimoor but he was silent because Hadia told him
that she talked to Fahad but at that time Taimoor did not know
Fahad. But he was not convinced and said, “I don’t believe in
you.”
Innerly, he was shocked when he came to know about her pics in
his cell phone.
Ahsan, “If you don’t believe then her character will change?”
His tone was like a question. But Taimoor had no answer because
he saw a lot of changes in her. They stayed for half an hour and
then left the park.
The next day, Sameer again came to see Taimoor. Two days ago,
they talked a lot on a topic and hardly had they finished the topic
of love. Now they again went out for a walk and started a
conversation about the nature of man. The topic was very
interesting and as they explained the interest became twice.


                                                                  65
Taimoor was very upset due to the matter of pics, so Sameer
investigated the reason.
Sameer, “You still think about her.”
Taimoor, “Yeah. No.”
Sameer, “You know, she betrayed you, and she was a selfish girl
according to me.”
Taimoor, “Maybe but what difference does it make?” After a
pause, Taimoor said, “Sameer! Tell me the nature of humans”.
Sameer, “You still have the same feelings and emotions for her.”
Sameer, “I don’t know because some of us are good and others
are bad, some are predators, and the others are prey and when
we talk about nature it is very difficult to define it and make a
conclusion on it”.
Taimoor, “According to me, to be greedy and selfish is the very
basic nature of humans”.
Sameer, “What? Are you mad? You said basic nature and then to
be greedy and selfish. Can you prove it?”
Taimoor, “I don’t know if I can or not but according to me
everyone in this world is selfish”.
Sameer, “Taimoor, you are mad. You don't know what you are
saying and what you are talking about?”
Taimoor, “I know. what I am talking about”.
Sameer, “Then give me a reason”.
Taimoor, “Tell me a job, you do without being greedy and
selfish”.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Sameer, “Not only me, everyone offers prayers”.
Taimoor, “Means you do not offer prayers to make Him happy?
So much so He will forgive you on the Day of Judgement”.
Sameer, “No, I do it for His happiness”.
Taimoor, “It’s your greedy nature, not only you, even everyone
does the same thing including me. The main thing why we should
we worship him ”.
Sameer became silent on this for a moment. Then Taimoor said,
“We are so greedy even you cannot imagine”.
Sameer, “How can you say?”
Taimoor pointed to a wasted shopping bag and said, “Tell me the
worth of that shopping bag”.
Sameer, “Everyone knows that there is no worth of that bag”.
Taimoor, “Last day I went to IBL (Imperial Bank Limited) where
a person got the same type of shopping bag and put 5,000,000 Rs.
in that bag. Now, tell me the worth of that bag at that time”.
Sameer, “Simply 5,000,000 Rs.”
At the same time a man on a bike had a shopping bag with him
and was passing beside them, Taimoor pointed to him and said,
“Can you slit that shopping bag”.
Sameer, “Are you mad, he’ll beat me”.
Taimoor, “Why will he beat you? Will he marry that bag or will
he decorate his house with that bag?”



                                                               67
Sameer, “He needs that bag, he has something in it and you are
talking about tearing it. He will kill me”.
Taimoor, “Can you tear that after his usage?”
Sameer, “Yeah, why not”.
Taimoor, “Will he allow you?”
Sameer, “Why not”.
Taimoor, “Why he will?”
Sameer, “Because there will be no more worth for that bag for
him”.
Taimoor, “You know one thing we replace the word need with
selfishness whenever we need and that’s all”.
Sameer, “You know Banu Qudsia said that everyone who comes
into our life has a reason for that, some teach us how to love,
some, how to carry the love, some, how to be patient, some to
dreams, and the other gives us the courage to fulfill them”.
Taimoor, “I think she skipped one thing which is the most
important”.
Sameer, “And what is that?”
Taimoor, “Some people tell us the reason why we hate?”
Sameer surprisingly, “Seriously Taimoor, you are mad. Hate is
not as powerful as love”.
Taimoor smiled and said, “According to me hate has more
intensity than love”.
Sameer, “You have your own philosophies”.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Taimoor, “You know according to me failure in love and other
tortures and the pains of life make philosophers, poets and mads.
And love produces more than fifty percent of philosophers, poets,
and mads”.
Sameer, “And you are mad”.
Taimoor, “Yes. You can say”.
Sameer, “Listen Taimoor, these days mature people do not love
someone, they only play with feelings. If you want to get pure love
and loyalty in return, then love with pets or children because
betrayal and cheating are born with the birth of rationality and
these both don’t have these things”.
Taimoor, “You know Khalil-Ul-Rehman Qamar said in his drama
‘Mere Pas Tum Ho’ that women never betray and if someone did
then she is not a woman and according to me she is a girl
(woman)”.
Sameer, “What did I say? And what you answer?”
Taimoor, “You called her a betrayal and I justified that she is
not”.
Sameer, “You mean she did not cheat on you?”
Taimoor, “No. She did not”.
Sameer, “Then what was that?”
Taimoor, “I heard that when an innocent businessman does
business with a clever man and the clever one uses his mind and
gets more profit and gives loss to the innocent one, that’s not
fraud, that’s business”.


                                                                69
Sameer, “Again you gave me the example of another thing”.
Taimoor smiled at it and said, “You will not understand”.
Sameer, “How will I understand when there will be no connection
between the question and answer?”
Taimoor, “Yes. You are right”.
Sameer, “Yes. I’m”.
Taimoor, “You know sometimes I cannot understand myself too,
that’s what I’m saying and what I’m talking about?”
Sameer, “I know why because you are going to be mad.”
And he laughed at him. Taimoor smiled too and replied,
“Maybe.”
They had almost finished their conversation and Sameer said, “I
will join you soon.”
Taimoor replied, “Why not.”
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy


                        Chapter Eight

As Taimoor changed his hostel and now he was not with Gull, he
visited Taimoor to see him because he was very upset about him.
When Taimoor saw him, he became happy because after his
breakup his friends Gull and Sameer were the cause of his
happiness and in this happiness, Aish added his job too. But when
Gull saw that he was very upset and weak, he became angry and
said to him, “What is this? I have told you a lot and tried to
convince you to move on but...”
He wanted to say something, but he did not. But Taimoor replied,
“I’m all right.”
Gull, “I’m mad.”
His tone was like he was asking a question ironically, but Taimoor
replied, “Seriously, I’m not.”
After these words again Gull tried to convince him and said,
“Listen, I did not tell you one thing. You remember, one day you
were on your duty at Scooper, and you missed her more than forty
calls.”
Taimoor replied, “Yeah. I remember.”
Gull, “She was talking to me. On that day I completely confirmed
that she did not love you, but I did not tell you. I have a lot like
this, but I cannot tell you. You could not see her clearly because
you loved her, and everyone says that love is blind.”
It was the second time when Taimoor was silent.


                                                                 71
Taimoor, “You all talk about her character, but I saw him
spiritually and I know she is right. When some scholar/professor
like the person will say her like you then I will be convinced
because the teachers say almost neutrally.”
Taimoor was already convinced that she betrayed him and was
not perfect by character, but he could not agree with them.
Gull, “No, one can convince you because you still love her.”
Taimoor, “Maybe.”
Gull, “You know someone said, ‘give as much love to someone as
you can, and if one will leave you then forget one because one is
not the suitor of love but of need. And you know she is the second
one. So, leave her and forget.”
Taimoor, “I can leave for the future but could not forget her
because I'm loyal by birth, and loyal never forget someone whom
they love. And I made a mistake, that's why she left me.”
Although he knew that he was betrayed by her, he defended them
to prove his true love.
Gull, “You are innocent, you don't know that you're loyal and
those who want to spend time with you will ignore your blunders,
and the person who wants to leave you, leave without any
reason.”
Taimoor, “Maybe.”
Gull, “Tell me one thing, what have you seen in her?”
Taimoor, “I don’t know but she has everything that attracts me.
She is intelligent, beautiful, and a lot which is indescribable.”
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Gull, “A philosopher said, ‘True love comes once in a woman’s
life, intelligent one valuing and appreciating that and the fool one
loses that due to her ego and attitude and regrets all the life’.
According to the philosopher, she is not intelligent, and no girl is
as prettier as her lover makes her.”
Taimoor, “You know the sign of the best relationship is that it
does not stop caring and worrying about you, despite your
differences and resentment. It was also said by a philosopher, and
you know she cared for me a lot when I faced anxiety attacks last
time. So, what will you say?”
Gull replied angrily, “You are not going to be well.” After that,
he went out.
The next day, Taimoor and Ahsan went to Mr. Zia’s office. After
half an hour, Hadia arrived there and talked to sir and then went
out.
When she went out Mr. Zia beware them by commenting,
“Beware of her and do not try to be frank with her, as a lover
because she has not these things like love and all.”
His comment was showing, as he wanted to say “She is not more
than a call girl.”
It killed Taimoor innerly and Mr. Zia actually insulted him,
because he did not know about their relationship. It was the most
valuable comment of all time after their breakup because it was
given by a teacher. And as Taimoor already said to his friends he
would believe it if one of his teachers would comment on her like
the boys commented. Maybe he expected that she would be
cleared by teachers and professors, but he was wrong. Now the


                                                                 73
truth came into being and he started to believe in Aliza’s
comments.
Now, he was broken and became very emotional and sad. He
didn't even understand how a teacher could say that type of word
and even Mr. Zia said right or not. It was a very confusing
situation for him. He always said, “Never decide to see the
crowd.”
Meaning takes the right decision not the decision towards the
majority of people. But maybe he proved his quotation wrong.
Now, he started believing that Hadia was disloyal.
After all that Ahsan said to him, “You should move on or to be
someone’s crush or love.”
Taimoor smiled at that and said, “I tried but I could not.”
Ahsan, “What you mean, you could not?”
Taimoor, “Once I was sitting in university and I saw a beautiful
girl. She was different and an exceptional girl, with an innocent
smile, she had a shine in her eyes, her hair was very beautiful and
dark black that converted day into night, her color was too white
that water could tarnish her, in an off-white suit, even she was a
reflection of fairies and nymphs, for a moment my heart beats for
her but at the same time he stabilized, I don’t know, why? Maybe
because as the people seem, they are not or as they are they do
not seem. Or perhaps now I have lost my trust in people. I could
not understand anything, but still, I was in an unconscious type of
situation.”
Ahsan was speechless and silent.
He was in his hostel, and he was alone. It was almost 6:30 in the
evening when he was sitting on the roof of his hostel and was very
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
sad and emotional. He was in a situation in which no one could
make the right decision. As he was very hurt and sad, the
comment of Mr. Zia increased the intensity of his sadness when
he thought about that.
He was sitting beside the wall with its support. It seemed he was
going to die. He was saying, “I was wrong, I made wrong
decisions, I made my relations myself. I never asked them what
they thought about me. I said to Saim, brother but he was not, I
said to Hadia, she was not, that’s the reason they both left me.”
These words were like what he wanted to say: never make your
relationships by yourself. These were his last words before
attempting suicide. Now, it was almost going to be 7:00 in the
evening when he cut his forearm vein and within seconds the floor
was covered with blood.
At the same time, Ahsan arrived there and was shocked when he
saw the floor which was covered with blood. He made a call to
Hanzla and told him all about the matter and called an ambulance,
he arrived within 5 minutes.
Taimoor was still in his senses and behaved like a normal person.
The ambulance arrived and they investigated the reason for the
injury which was manipulated and told them it was an accidental
injury due to the breakdown of a windowpane. The ambulance
got him first aid and then took him to the DHQ Gujranwala. He
got an operation in which his vein was wasted but it was not the
main one.
After that, they took him to the hostel again and the day of 27 July
passed.


                                                                 75
After a month Taimoor met his friend Sameer. When Sameer saw
him, he felt that Taimoor was a bit upset, so he asked the reason
and then he shared an experience with him.
       He said, “I was sitting beside a high wall of Imperial
       University. It was evening time, and the sun was almost
       going to set. I could feel the feelings of the sun. It seemed
       he was trying to avoid himself from the darkness of night.
       Maybe I was wrong or making a mistake but still, it
       seemed, he was carrying a fear of disappearing. It was
       very hard for me to describe the feelings of the sun at that
       time.
       It seemed that he was trying to convey a message to me,
       “Please! I want to stay here; I just want to stay with you.”
       I was almost unconscious, it was hard for me to reply to
       him, I was in the state of a carved man, like a statue. Even
       though I was trying to talk to him, I felt like my tongue was
       sealed with a lock of misfortune. Maybe he was trying to
       say, “I have a lot of enemies, who drag me into the
       darkness. I am trying to avoid it, but it is impossible for
       me, I’ve been trying since the start of the universe, please
       help me!”
       It was not a sound but a silent noise around me, I couldn't
       hear anything else at that time.
       I felt as if he was trying to catch up to me with his infinite
       and lengthless hands and arms or maybe to earth, but I
       think that was me. He had no time, and the time started
       when the darkness became dominant because the wind
       treasoned him with the help of clouds, they made the sun
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
       armless and then he became red as his blood spread all
       over the earth and made that bloody.
       I was sitting on the chair, I was helpless, and it was my
       helplessness that could not help me to help him. In the end,
       he said, Sorry dude, I didn’t know you couldn’t help
       yourself in your love, how can you help me? At the time of
       my death, you gave me a lesson no one can help others in
       the matter of deathless life”.
       He was dying, I was watching with helpless eyes. He told
       me one thing and that is I am a coward, nothing else.
Taimoor was very emotional, while he was narrating that incident
and Sameer was too.
After a fortnight he was slightly recovered, and he visited the
university where he saw that Hadia was with a boy, whose name
was Faheem and he was Taimoor’s friend. But as Taimoor did not
care for her (Externally) as now he knew her character and what
type of girl she was, that was the reason he didn't care whether
she was with a boy or boys, so he wasn't surprised. But he thought
whenever Faheem tried to feel him or wanted to show him that
his girl was now with him, Taimoor thought that Faheem was
eating his thrown pieces of rotten bread. He felt pity for Faheem
whenever he thought about what type of girl he had.
Even Taimoor saw her in his class because they had the same
sections, when he saw he didn’t feel anything awkward, she was
the same as others. Her voice was also a part of the noise of class
which was more than a heavenly song before. He was in a state of
shocking person, what was he facing?


                                                                77
So, he narrated the whole incident to the Gull, and he said, “Dear
buddy, you know one thing, we feel something, for someone till
that time when that one becomes a rebel due to that thing and
when one becomes a rebel like a devil, that feeling disappears
automatically. She became a rebellion now so your feelings about
her disappeared. She just missed you; Maybe Allah knew her
that’s the reason, she couldn’t stay with you, but she will be
heartbroken over this act of leaving you”.
Taimoor, “I agreed with you on the first comment but not on the
second. Because one will realize the good thing whenever one
recognizes oneself, self-recognition becomes the reason for
regret. But she will not be able to because she thinks that she is
right and doing good as well, because the change in boyfriends is
her job and passion and she is very passionate about that. So, she
will not recognize herself. Self-recognition is not part of her life,
and my ALLAH Almighty does not give the power of regret-ness
and self-recognition to this type of person”.
Gull, “How do you know that she will not be able to do that? I’m
not arguing with you because I knew her reality and I told you as
well but I’m curious to know the reason for your belief”.
Taimoor, “Really you want to know the reason?”
Gull, “Yeah”.
Taimoor, “Then listen, you know that I went back to my village to
see off a friend for Dubai”.
The tone of Taimoor was like a question so Gull replied, “Yeah,
I know”.
Taimoor, “You know who that was?”
Gull, “No, I don’t know”.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Taimoor, “You will be surprised when you know the person.” He
paused for a while and then said, “He was Saim”.
When Gull heard the name, he was surprised and questioned
Taimoor, “You went there for him, but you said that he doesn’t
know the meaning of friendship”.
He replied, “Yeah, I said that, but he made me calls twice and
desired to meet with me”.
Gull, “And you agreed?”.
Taimoor, “Yeah”.
Gull, “How and why?”
Taimoor, “Because before dying I was very emotional and
serious about her association and matters but now it doesn’t
matter whether someone is associated with her or not”.
Gull, “What he says?”
Taimoor, “He just apologized to me and wants to tell me the
reality of Hadia”.
Gull, “Did you?”
Taimoor, “Yeah, I did”.
Gull, “But why?”
Taimoor, “Because I was angry with him due to her but now, she
is not more than a shameful and insulted association with me. I
feel insulted whenever someone knows about our relationship,
and one will be surprised that I was in a relationship with that
type of girl, and I think he realized his fault”.

                                                             79
Gull, “And what did he want to tell you?”
Taimoor, “If I essence that in one word then he wanted to tell that
she is a characterless girl, and if I explained that, he claimed that
she wanted to shift the brother and sister-like relationship into
lovers”.
Now gull believed that she was not more than a call girl truly.
Taimoor added, “Many boys claimed that she desired the same
thing in front of them and now I believe, they spoke the truth”.
Gull, “I am still shocked, I knew that she is a characterless girl
since the first day but at the highest level I didn’t know”.
Taimoor, “I was in the same state when Saim claimed that, and I
know he cannot tell a lie”.
Gull, “Tell me one thing, you see her with different boys, and you
do not feel anything?”
Taimoor, “No”. But it was not true at all.
Gull was surprised and questioned again, “How is it possible?”
Taimoor, “Listen! I do, if she was sincere with me and still alone
and sad but as she had changed two or three boys after me then
how can I? I am happy that she left me otherwise I will be ruined
if I marry that type of girl”.
Gull was almost convinced.
Taimoor added, “You know I was told that Ahsan was with her
but still I don’t know maybe they were in a relationship”.
Gull, “I think you can ruin her but till you did not, why?”
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Taimoor, “Yeah, I can but still I didn’t, I controlled myself
because according to me when you destroy someone, destroy one
in that way that one cannot stabilize again, so that’s the reason I
am waiting and that will be not my revenge even that will be the
punishment to her for those sins which she done with beats”. That
was another lie because he could not say all the things straight.
Actually, he couldn’t.
He added, “You know everyone is a hero in one’s story, but don’t
know how I became the villain of my story”.
Gull was speechless at that.




                                                                81
                        Chapter Nine

At the end of the university, he got a lot of tags even though he
had argumentative conversations with his seniors, but he never
gave up. He made them speechless by asking counter questions.
At that time he read hundreds of books like Socrates, Aristotle,
and Plato in biographies, Sophie's World, The Art of War, Man’s
Search for Meaning, Meditation, The Gay Science and A History
of Western Philosophy in Philosophy, You Can Win, You Can
Become The Person You Want To Be, Self-Recognition of
motivation based, Hamlet, Macbeth, The Rivals, Oedipus Rex,
The Jew Of Malta, Alchemist, Troilus and Cressida, Julius
Caesar, The Comedy of Errors in dramas, Pride And Prejudice,
The Tail Of Two Cities, Gulliver’s Travels, The Return Of
Natives, Tobah-To-Nasoh, The Heart Of Darkness, The Great
Gatsby, Brave New World in novels, Forty-Eight Laws Of Power,
The Art Of Happiness, The Laws Of Human Nature, The Book Of
Healing, Making Yourself Indispensable, The Prince and Brief
Answers To The Big Questions in argumentative and descriptive
essays and many more like that. So, he had enough knowledge to
convince anyone.
Even he learned many things about life, as it did not matter to him
whether someone left him or not or left and went into his enemy’s
world or perhaps, he had no enemies now because nothing
mattered in front of him, and enemies came into existence when
the things mattered. He never blamed anyone, he blamed himself.
And the worst change in his life was the hate and the lack of trust
for other people, especially for girls.
He became one of those people whom no one could hurt. He
wanted to become a successful person in his own words,
“Successful has different words in different minds some said it’s
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
money, the other fame, and some respect but according to me,
when a person becomes successful, he doesn’t need to ask for a
contact number, he doesn’t need to ask for a name or told one’s
name in first because when one becomes like that person then
people want to know about that one and they ask you for your
contact information and a piece of happiness is also a part of
success. This is success in front of me”.
Even he changed the definitions of many things for him and
changed himself from the better to the best way.
After a rain, he met his friend Zaini and she asked him about her
first and last relationship, which meant how they met and all that,
so Taimoor described that in some lines, but Zaini could not
understand that either he told only a single scene or the whole
journey of his relationship.
       He started, “I was just sitting at a table, and I was waiting
       for someone and perhaps that was a girl whom I had never
       seen, after a few seconds I made a call to her. I was very
       excited and a little bit confused, because it was the very
       first time, when I was waiting for a lady.
       After a while, I saw a girl, fully covered with clothes, and
       was just coming to me when I saw her, I felt that the time
       had just stopped and there was no breeze. The drizzling
       rays of the sun became soft, I could catch them. I was in
       complete silence even though I could hear my heartbeat,
       which was very fast, and I was anxious that it might stop.
       It was hard to breathe at that time. I felt as if I had found
       the element of immortality I had been searching for since
       birth. I felt something special that I had never felt before,


                                                                 83
I could feel the stillness of time, it was beautiful and
unforgettable, I swear.
When she approached me, she greeted me and sat down
in front of me. We sat in front of each other for more than
two hours. At that time, I was unable to see the
background, the noises around us, or the people around
us even for a while I forgot myself too. I was almost
unconscious in her eyes, they just wanted to say, I am here
for you, for your happiness, for your future, and to make
you special and to feel you a piece of eternity. She was
with me. Just for a second, I saw her hair. They were
curly, I never liked curly hair, but they were the most
beautiful in the world and I felt. Her lips were very soft
and thin, which was full of transparent chap-stick. They
were jasmine in color and smelled of rose. I just wanted
to touch them. I don’t know why but I want to, I was
drowned in her eyes, they just hypnotized me.
Hardly, I observed that there was a red birthmark on her
right eyebrows and that was very prominent and suited
her. Her color was fair, but her facial expressions were
killing me, and they were just controlling me. I
remembered, for an instant, I realized that there must be
another birthmark on her body that was beautifying her,
and maybe that was, her nose was very beautiful which
added to her beauty. I saw her forehead which was very
clear and kissable, I wanted to, but I did not at that time.
She was talking to me, and she wanted me to talk to her.
She wore me her wristband and just smiled. Perhaps, I
gifted her a watch along with a stroller, ring, and Anklet.”
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
When he was telling her, he wanted to cry, and cry hard, even
heaven could listen to him, but he could not. He wanted to drink
the Lethe or the Styx, he desired to be beaten on the head.
“At last, I kissed her on her forehead and those were my feelings,
but I think she could not understand. I wanted to see her without
a stroller while she wore specs. It was my desire. To fulfill my
desire, she just cut my veins and used my blood as a chapstick.
Her lips were full of reddish glow and shine. She wore a light pink
stroller and opened her hair with her glasses. She looked like a
fairy; it could neither be her nor anyone else, but she seemed very
cute in that costume. Although she tried to kill me, but that did not
matter to me. I was full of blood and smiled and then just opened
my eyes, but I was full of blood.”
She was amazed after listening to all that.




                                                                  85
                         Chapter Ten

The time had passed, and Taimoor was happy somehow. He
became a writer, he wrote novels, dramas, and short stories. He
also wrote some famous articles, which was the major reason for
his fame. Now, he promised himself to not make any mistakes as
he made in the past, he would try to make no mistakes.
In his interview, he answered when the interviewer asked him,
“Sir, you ever loved?”
He replied, “Yeah, I did, and I still do with the same one, but I
hate her too and it started more than five rains and twenty suns
ago.”
She said, “You ever missed her?”
He remained silent for a moment, then replied, “When someone
dies, we miss but when someone leaves us, we ought to forget”.
When he was telling all this, he was not sitting like Buddha, even
though he wore a mask.
Moreover, she asked him, “What would you say about love? Who
is the best, the loser one or the gainer one?”
Taimoor, “Well, because I am a loser one. So, I will say the loser
one. According to me, when we get something, we lose its
preciousness, its beauty, and its value. The actual thing, which we
demand to be suspicious and curious for anything, and when we
come to know all about that thing, the curiosity despairs and we
just left with chaos.”
The interviewer asked another question, “Sir if she meets with you
at this time and asks for patch up, what would you say to her?”
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
Taimoor, “I will ask her first, do you love me? If she says yes. I
will say if I am unable to have the very same love for you then,
will you stay for me, will you ignore my mistakes, or you will do
the same as you already did? If she said yes, then I’ll answer her
at that time”.
(Although he knew all about her mean character because it was
constructed to her or might not, he still loved her and in the safe
and healthy part of his heart, she existed as blood so, internally he
wanted to say, “Yeah, I am still waiting for her”. But he could not
confess in front of anyone.)
Maybe he was thinking he would deny it or something else, but
he was in deep thought. Perhaps he wanted to say, “Yeah sure in
your next birth if you will born as a human” Because he was not
settled, he was still somehow emotional in this matter.
The first session of the interview ended.
As the first session of the interview ended and the second started,
in this session, the interviewer raised a very interesting question.
Maybe Sameer was also waiting for that question. The
conversation was just related to the relationship of our youth.
Taimoor, “According to me girls rarely betray someone, but boys
are more in numbers and intensity, girls just after the better
options, and when they find the better one, leave the first one, and
it’s the same for all ages”.
Interviewer, “I could not get it, can you elaborate it, because
normally everyone says, girls betray, and I saw too. Being a
female, I am ashamed of this but it’s a bitter reality.”
Taimoor, “You are right but I’m not wrong. According to you and
the rest of the people, when a girl leaves someone, after that if she
                                                                   87
has any relationship, it is considered betrayal. But in reality, what
betrayal a couple of people know. When someone changes one’s
boyfriend or girlfriend that’s not betrayal, that’s their comfort
zone. For a time, we are the comfort zone for someone and when
they lose interest in us, it means losing one’s comfort zone, one
leaves without any mistakes. And we blame one cheater, snake,
and several names we have for that individual. And according to
me if someone loses interest in you or has lost one’s comfort zone,
one must leave.”
Interviewer, “So, what is betrayal according to you?”
Taimoor, “Betrayal is the nastiest thing in my dictionary. Even I
personify it with the spit of a pig. Whenever I talk about betrayal
it seems. I’m talking about the most dangerous sin in the world.
And this is the thing that happens when we trust someone blindly.
It is the act of our beloved, acting with us being our lover but at
the same time he did the same thing with someone else. Maybe
that is true and our’s are fake. It’s a kind of sharing, and even
ALLAH Almighty does not like sharing and will not forget then
how a human being can?”
When he explained the matter, it seemed that he was betrayed.
At the end of the conversation he said, “You know what the
saddest thing about betrayal? It never comes from our enemy.”
(Picky Blinders)
Interview ends.
-The Shadow of the Light Fairy
After that when he was on the way home, he thought “The
quotations are just words, they have nothing to do with real life.
In quotations, it is said, Do Good Have Good, but in reality, we
don’t have such things. In reality, the life is something else”.
Also, he was thinking, “Everyone is a hero of his own story, but
I could not become the hero of mine and if I am the hero of my
story then I could not win in the end. I am a loser, I gained
nothing.”
Perhaps he has learnt the lesson that movies and dreams are
always very different from reality. In movies, heroes almost win
but in reality, they don’t, they just have losses and pain. They are
full of laments and their lives are full of miseries, even if they
don’t seem heroes. People construct them as villains of time and
devils of the era. He desired to say, “Life has the most dangerous
stink, it stabs the person, who wants to seek it.” He was also
thinking, “What if she were pierced with Golden Cupidian and I
with Led, what if she would feel the love, what if she would meet
to ecstasy, today things were some other else.”
He was dispersed and fragmented by thoughts, emotions,
feelings, and actions, he regretted, and perhaps by every bit of
hisness, he didn’t know at what? On the choices, he made or what
he had lost and what he gained. He didn’t know anything, not
even himself.
